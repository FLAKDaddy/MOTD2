## This server boasts 3 distinct modes/maps:
### "Ironside": Reserved for honorable duels. Respect the sanctity of combat here.
### "Dread": Navigate the labyrinthine horde dungeon, aiming to escape before time runs out.
### "AeternisTesting": Explore a vast map brimming with thrilling mini-games; a personal favorite.

# Royal Decrees
### "Ironside" is exclusively for duels; honor this sacred decree. While friendly FFA is permitted, RDM against those seeking honorable combat is strictly prohibited.

### Use of enchanted constructs known as 'hacks' or 'cheats' is strictly forbidden. (Except for the ragdoll exploit - that one's just too amusing!)
 
### Ye Shall Simp For The Queen, RedSiren
#### Let your praises resonate like sweet melodies in her ears, your devotion steadfast as the mightiest castle walls.

## Disregard these sacred decrees at your peril! Those caught in violation shall prepare thy tight rear for the throbbing, LONG & HARD shaft of justice known as the banhammer.
